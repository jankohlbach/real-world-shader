          processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of

        <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
        <p>
          With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail
          below, users and data subjects have the right
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed,
            information about the data being processed, further information
            about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf.
            also Art. 15 GDPR);
          </li>
          <li>
            to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art.
            16 GDPR);
          </li>
          <li>
            to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17
            DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as
            stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per
            Art. 18 GDPR;
          </li>
          <li>
            to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by
            them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers
            (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
          </li>
          <li>
            to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe
            that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in
            breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to
          whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or
          restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18
          GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is
          impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users
          have a right to information about these recipients.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right
            to object to the controller’s future processing of their data
            pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection
            to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is
            permissible.

        <p>
          Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked
          as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the
          deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage
          obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.
        </p>
        <h4>Contact</h4>
        <p>
          If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide
          will be used for the purpose of processing your request. We must have
          this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we
          will not be able to answer it in full or at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b)
          GDPR.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and
          there is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an
          order or contract resulted therefrom.
        </p>
        <h4>Server data</h4>
        <p>
          For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet
          browser to us or to our server provider will be collected, especially
          to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record
          the type and version of your browser, operating system, the website
          from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited,
          the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which
          you visited our site.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in
          association with any other of your data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our
          legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality,
          and security of our website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless
          continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case,
          all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the
          investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.
