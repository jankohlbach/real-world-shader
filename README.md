# real world shader

This is just a little playground for me. I wanted a place to collect various shader effects that I can actually use in real world client projects.

All of the code of this website is public so you can see how I am doing this and copy it for your projects.

I also made the shaders directly accessible for you to copy or expand on.
Tutorials may be added later on.

Feedback, ideas, and everything else always welcome.
